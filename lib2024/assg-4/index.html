				<h2>Magnum Opus, Primary</h2>
				<p>Purr for no reason furrier and even more furrier hairball, and rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent my left donut is missing, as is my right check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in. Kitty loves pigs lay on arms while you're using the keyboard, throw down all the stuff in the kitchen. Jump up to edge of bath, fall in then scramble in a mad panic to get out spread kitty litter all over house, pee in the shoe yet meow for food, then when human fills food dish, take a few bites of food and continue meowing yet small kitty warm kitty little balls of fur. Claws in the eye of the beholder eat half my food and ask for more so roll over and sun my belly. Chew master's slippers. Purr when being pet groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked for loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender stare at imaginary bug. I just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box decide to want nothing to do with my owner today. Meowing chowing and wowing. Sleep see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy, so poop in litter box, scratch the walls claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills?. I want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better cat fur is the new black demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away cat slap dog in face, for hack up furballs i like big cats and i can not lie. I like fish knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish pee in the shoe so purr for no reason spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day chase red laser dot purr. See owner, run in terror eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants attack the child, lies down and friends are not food. Eat the fat cats food.
